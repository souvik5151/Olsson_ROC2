# Olsson.wl

A *Mathematica* package for deriving linear transformations of multivariate hypergeometric functions based on the method of Olsson [1]. It is based on the work :

[Olsson.wl : a Mathematica package for the computation of linear transformations of multivariable hypergeometric functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01189)

# ROC2.wl

The companion package *ROC2.wl* can find the region of convergence of double variable hypergeometric functions. 

The commands and usage of the packages are discussed in the article in great detail.
